    "Artificial Intelligence refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human \n",
    "intelligence. These tasks include things like understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, making decisions, and \n",
    "solving problems. AI systems can be rule-based or learned from data.\n",

    "predictions or decisions based on the data they've been trained on.\n",

    "Example: Consider an email spam filter. Instead of programming explicit rules for identifying spam, a machine learning model \n",
