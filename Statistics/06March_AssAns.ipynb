    "Ans - Statistics can be divided in two types 1- Descriptive and 2- inferential statistics\n",
    "    1- Descriptive Statistics: Descriptive statistics involve methods used to summarize, organize, and present data in a \n",
    "    meaningful way. They provide a snapshot of the main characteristics of a dataset without making inferences about the \n",
    "    larger population. Descriptive statistics are often used to provide a clear and concise summary of data for easier \n",

    " Example: Suppose a company wants to understand the average age of its employees. They collect data on the ages of all \n",

    "    Inferential Statistics:\n",
    "    Inferential statistics involve making inferences or predictions about a larger population based on a sample of data. \n",

    "      The main types of data are:\n",
    "\n",
    "      Nominal Data:  Nominal data are categorical and represent distinct categories or labels without any inherent order. \n",
